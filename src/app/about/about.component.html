  What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.

  I can't see a thing in this helmet. This is not going to work. Why didn't you say so before? I did say so before! Where are you taking this...thing? Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight. I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. Look out! We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Everything is under control. Situation normal. What happened? Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? We're sending a squad up. Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous. Who is this? What's your operating number? Boring conversation anyway. Luke! We're going to have company!
